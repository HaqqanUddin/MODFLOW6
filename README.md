# Groundwater Modeling

This repository presents a comprehensive groundwater modeling project for the Quetta region using MODFLOW 6, a numerical groundwater flow modeling tool developed by the USGS. The project focuses on simulating groundwater flow dynamics, evaluating aquifer properties, and providing insights for sustainable water resource management. The model represents the hydrogeology of the Quetta region, including aquifer layers, boundary conditions, and recharge zones, while integrating local topography and hydroclimatic data for accuracy. It includes calibrated aquifer properties such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield. Groundwater recharge zones are derived, while abstraction data accounts for domestic, agricultural, and industrial usage. To minimize computation time for this large-scale model, the MODFLOW 6 simulation was split into smaller parts using Mf6Splitter, a tool designed to divide large models into manageable segments. Each segment was run independently to take advantage of multi-core processing capabilities. Once the simulations were completed, the results were reassembled to obtain the final groundwater flow solutions. This process significantly reduced runtime and enhanced computational efficiency without compromising the model's accuracy.
